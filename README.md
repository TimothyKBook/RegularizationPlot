# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Regularization Plot :chart_with_downwards_trend:
This is a very, very rough work in progress.  The goal of this shiny is to illustrate the effects of changing the tuning parameter for penalized regression.  The end version of the Shiny will have three panes: one for each of LASSO regression, ridge regression, and a regularized smoothing spline.

## TODOS:
#### :white_check_mark: Establish Shiny UI
#### :white_check_mark: LASSO Plot
  * :white_check_mark: Create plotting framework
  * :white_check_mark: Produce tuning slider
  * :white_check_mark: Integrate plot into Shiny
  * :white_check_mark: Prettify plot

#### :o2: Ridge Plot
  * :o2: Create plotting framework
  * :o2: Produce tuning slider
  * :o2: Integrate plot into Shiny
  * :o2: Prettify plot

#### :o2: Spline Plot
  * :o2: Create plotting framework
  * :o2: Produce tuning slider
  * :o2: Integrate plot into Shiny
  * :o2: Prettify plot

#### :o2: Stress test, make sure it's all integrated properly
